						<span>Mar 20, 2021</span>

					<p>Why do the hard things still feel so hard to do.</p>
<p>I know that I procrastinate a lot and I still give up on 80% of my projects.</p>
<p>Because they are hard. There are too many unknowns.</p>
<p>There is no clear direction and I feel lost.</p>
<p>This is the hardest thing for me to find a way when there is no clear path.</p>
<p>Which makes me think if there is ever a clear path.</p>
<p>There would always be so many unknowns.</p>
<p>So many of my desires have no clear path on how I would achieve them.</p>
<p>Facing them all unkowns one by one &hellip;</p>
<p>Where do I begin?</p>
<p>What do I do?</p>
<p>All I have this desire to achieve the final goal. And I have no clarity on how to achieve them.</p>
<p>When there is no clarity, I think the project would not finish most likely.</p>
<p>Should I break my desire into steps. Into time gaps. Into progression steps?</p>
<p>I want all my desires to be completed instantly.</p>
<p>I want no desire to remain cause all of them are complete.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have a clear path on achieving them.</p>
<p>Should I keep trying?</p>
<p>Should I..</p>
<p>Or is it a wasted attempted.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the use..!!</p>
<p>If there is no clarity on how to achieve them.</p>
<p>The moment I have clarity on how to do it, it usually gets done.</p>
<p>There is no stopping me in that moment of clarity. It may last hours or days but it still feels like a moment.</p>
<p>And without that clarity , I am just lost with no clear path on how to achieve whatever I want.</p>
<p>Should I just give up? I am asking this very seriously.</p>
<p>What if you say &ldquo;Give up&rdquo; Should I give up then? <strong>Should I listen to someone else on what I should give up on?</strong></p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think I will give up if someone tells me to.. so no use asking others.</p>
<p>The only choice I have got is then to carry on doing what I must to achieve what I must desire.</p>
<p>The only question then is how do I gain that clarity consistently. This is something I must answer myself.</p>
<p>Or I could also ask myself, what should I do to never lose that sense of clarity? Why do I lose my sense of clarity.</p>
<p>Because I rest. I give up after achieving some part of my desire.</p>
<p>There is inconsistent follow through. So I can never rest..</p>
<p>I guess then only solution is that I will have to rest only when I die.</p>
<p>As long as  I am alive, I gotta do anything and everything for whatever is important to me.</p>
