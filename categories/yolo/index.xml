      <description>Today is a sunday, so everyone should rest.
The whole world should stop doing whatever they are doing just because it is Sunday.
This is what we are told.
It&amp;rsquo;s been seven days. Seven times has the sun come up since then. The last time it came out.
That means, I can rest.
Feels like a weird logic. But why is this being told by everyone..
I want to rest. I need rest.</description>

      <description>This is the last time I am creating a new Hugo block. This is the last time I try to change themes.
Let&amp;rsquo;s keep it simple from now on.
This is the last time I am updating Hugo.
You can say I am hard stuck on 0.79 from now on.
I am angry cause I am wasting time and I know it :P
See you.</description>
