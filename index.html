						<span>Mar 21, 2021</span>
					</div>

					<p>Today is a sunday, so everyone should rest.</p>
<p>The whole world should stop doing whatever they are doing just because it is Sunday.</p>
<p>This is what we are told.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been seven days. Seven times has the sun come up since then. The last time it came out.</p>
<p>That means, I can rest.</p>
<p>Feels like a weird logic. But why is this being told by everyone..</p>
<p>I want to rest. I need rest. Seems weird. Do I wanna rest? YEAH but is rest the same as procrastination.</p>
<p>What if my brain fog from rest never goes away.</p>
<p>I know that I can only rest when I die. Since there is no other choice I guess.</p>
<p>What do I do..</p>
<p>Watching youtube does not feel like rest. It just means that I switched the task that I was doing from something productive into something non-productive I guess.</p>
<p>What everyone is trying to describe to me is not rest. It is rest from a activity only to engage in another.</p>
<p>I am thinking.. what if I stop switching activities whenever I achieve something. Do I become stale, tired and boring then cause I did not switch. Or is it just my ADD monster trying to convince me that everything is alright and let&rsquo;s switch tasks already. Just give up on the same thing already.</p>
<p>Give up and try out something new. Is what my mind tells me every moment. Never sticks to it&rsquo;s own decisions. Does not even try to stick to what it has decided.</p>
<p>If my mind is not listening to me, then it&rsquo;s just a monster I guess. What do I do of this monster.</p>
<p>What if I could resolve all this by sorting out my own mind. That would be very epic.</p>
<p>I just need to listen to myself then. Not try to avoid whatever is going on with myself. With my own mind and my body and it would all be okay. I know that I am not just my mind or just this body. Then what the hell am I..</p>
<p>Am I everything.. Or am I nothing.. Or both.</p>

					<p>Why do the hard things still feel so hard to do.</p>
<p>I know that I procrastinate a lot and I still give up on 80% of my projects.</p>
<p>Because they are hard. There are too many unknowns.</p>
<p>There is no clear direction and I feel lost.</p>
<p>This is the hardest thing for me to find a way when there is no clear path.</p>
<p>Which makes me think if there is ever a clear path.</p>
<p>There would always be so many unknowns.</p>
<p>So many of my desires have no clear path on how I would achieve them.</p>
<p>Facing them all unkowns one by one &hellip;</p>
<p>Where do I begin?</p>
<p>What do I do?</p>
<p>All I have this desire to achieve the final goal. And I have no clarity on how to achieve them.</p>
<p>When there is no clarity, I think the project would not finish most likely.</p>
<p>Should I break my desire into steps. Into time gaps. Into progression steps?</p>
<p>I want all my desires to be completed instantly.</p>
<p>I want no desire to remain cause all of them are complete.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have a clear path on achieving them.</p>
<p>Should I keep trying?</p>
<p>Should I..</p>
<p>Or is it a wasted attempted.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the use..!!</p>
<p>If there is no clarity on how to achieve them.</p>
<p>The moment I have clarity on how to do it, it usually gets done.</p>
<p>There is no stopping me in that moment of clarity. It may last hours or days but it still feels like a moment.</p>
<p>And without that clarity , I am just lost with no clear path on how to achieve whatever I want.</p>
<p>Should I just give up? I am asking this very seriously.</p>
<p>What if you say &ldquo;Give up&rdquo; Should I give up then? <strong>Should I listen to someone else on what I should give up on?</strong></p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think I will give up if someone tells me to.. so no use asking others.</p>
<p>The only choice I have got is then to carry on doing what I must to achieve what I must desire.</p>
<p>The only question then is how do I gain that clarity consistently. This is something I must answer myself.</p>
<p>Or I could also ask myself, what should I do to never lose that sense of clarity? Why do I lose my sense of clarity.</p>
<p>Because I rest. I give up after achieving some part of my desire.</p>
<p>There is inconsistent follow through. So I can never rest..</p>
<p>I guess then only solution is that I will have to rest only when I die.</p>
<p>As long as  I am alive, I gotta do anything and everything for whatever is important to me.</p>

					<p>No one in the social media would like you to know about this. Even if you are aware of it , no one will bring it up</p>
<p>In social media, the currency is attention.</p>
<p>In video games, the currency is attention.</p>
<p>In porn, the currency is attention.</p>
<p>In subpar relationships, the currency is attention.</p>
<p>If attention was a currency, how are you spending it?</p>
<p>This could determine everything in your life depending on how deep your attention has been robbed from you.</p>
<p>The only thing worth attending to is your ownself.</p>
<p>Rest all could be fake. Scripted. Out of touch with reality. Could be propaganda. Could be clickbaits. Could be spam. Could be anything.</p>
<p>I am sorry for having stole your attention here in this article.</p>
<p>Pay attention only to your self.</p>
