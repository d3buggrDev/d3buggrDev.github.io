						<span>Mar 21, 2021</span>
					</div>

					<p>Today is a sunday, so everyone should rest.</p>
<p>The whole world should stop doing whatever they are doing just because it is Sunday.</p>
<p>This is what we are told.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been seven days. Seven times has the sun come up since then. The last time it came out.</p>
<p>That means, I can rest.</p>
<p>Feels like a weird logic. But why is this being told by everyone..</p>
<p>I want to rest. I need rest. Seems weird. Do I wanna rest? YEAH but is rest the same as procrastination.</p>
<p>What if my brain fog from rest never goes away.</p>
<p>I know that I can only rest when I die. Since there is no other choice I guess.</p>
<p>What do I do..</p>
<p>Watching youtube does not feel like rest. It just means that I switched the task that I was doing from something productive into something non-productive I guess.</p>
<p>What everyone is trying to describe to me is not rest. It is rest from a activity only to engage in another.</p>
<p>I am thinking.. what if I stop switching activities whenever I achieve something. Do I become stale, tired and boring then cause I did not switch. Or is it just my ADD monster trying to convince me that everything is alright and let&rsquo;s switch tasks already. Just give up on the same thing already.</p>
<p>Give up and try out something new. Is what my mind tells me every moment. Never sticks to it&rsquo;s own decisions. Does not even try to stick to what it has decided.</p>
<p>If my mind is not listening to me, then it&rsquo;s just a monster I guess. What do I do of this monster.</p>
<p>What if I could resolve all this by sorting out my own mind. That would be very epic.</p>
<p>I just need to listen to myself then. Not try to avoid whatever is going on with myself. With my own mind and my body and it would all be okay. I know that I am not just my mind or just this body. Then what the hell am I..</p>
<p>Am I everything.. Or am I nothing.. Or both.</p>

					<p>This is the last time I am creating a new Hugo block. This is the last time I try to change themes.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s keep it simple from now on.</p>
<p>This is the last time I am updating Hugo.</p>
<p>You can say I am hard stuck on 0.79 from now on.</p>
<p>I am angry cause I am wasting time and I know it :P</p>
<p>See you.</p>
